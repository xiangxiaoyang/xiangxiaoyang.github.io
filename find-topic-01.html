                    Butokata was one of the most feared
                    figures in Japanese music at that time.
                    He was a veteran of Japanese rock
                    from the 1980s to the 1990s and even
                    beyond the 21st century. His live per-
                    formances and numerous achieve-
                    ments have always been highly re-
                    spected among Japanese music circles
                    and fans.
