                    , 1993 and 2005 are bound to be
                    extraordinary years. In 1991, Beyond
                    held the life touch concert at hung hom
                    stadium in Hong Kong. The concert ac-
                    tually ran for six. November 24, 1991,
                    Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, is the last stop
                    of this concert.

                    Hong Kong, Beyond performed
                    many of their classics, including"I
                    really love you", "wide open sky"and
                    "cold and rainy night". The concert
                    made Beyond the first rock group to
                    play at the red house. In the days that
                    followed, it became their most fre-

                    For Beyond, I always have a special
                    complex exists. My father's favorite
                    three people in his life, one of them is
                    wong ka kui in Beyond, the other two
                    are Leslie cheung and Anita mui. In my
                    memory, other children may listen to
                    the bedtime story"Snow White"or lul-
                    laby, but I was my father sang me the
                    song Beyond. I would hum most of
                    their songs before I was 15 years old,
                    and I sang with my father in KTV sever-
                    al times in poor cantonese.

                <p class="find-activity-fontMargin ">
                    At that time, I thought my father was
                    really handsome, with a handsome
                    face, thin and tall, looking at me and my
                    mother and smiling between singing.
                    At that time, I often thought that when l
                    grow up, I must find a man who can
                    sing the songs of domestic colts and
                    play the guitar to accompany me to the
                    old age.

                    on a Japanese stage. Ten years later,
                    cheung fell to his death. There was a
                    time when my dad hardly went out, sit-
                    ting on the couch watching their CDS,
                    live concerts, music videos and so on.

                    The song Beyond can be said that each
                    capital is contained a specific feelings.
                    "Like you", a profound and meaningful
                    love between men and women; "Wide
                    open sky", a hero in the four lofty ambi-
                    tion. The aforementioned 1991 concert
                    version of"I really love you"is about
                    the most touching, selfless and warm
                    maternal love in the world. The song
                    praises the great maternal love, but
                    also contains the maternal love of
                    Thanksgiving and blessings for the
                    mother.
